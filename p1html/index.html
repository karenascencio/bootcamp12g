          The winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus), also known as the
          Russian dwarf hamster, Djungarian hamster, striped dwarf hamster,
          Siberian hamster, or Siberian dwarf hamster, is one of three species
          of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and typically half
          the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along
          with all Phodopus species.

          Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) is a species of hamster
          in the genus Phodopus. It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas
          in honor of Charles William Campbell, who collected the first specimen
          in Mongolia on July 1, 1902. It is distinguished from the closely
          related Djungarian hamster as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on
          its crown.
