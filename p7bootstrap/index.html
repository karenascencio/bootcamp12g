                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I 
                        learned were current, if not more so, in the company I 
                        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                        I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some 
                        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
                        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled 
                        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most 
                        grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve 
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer 
                        at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure 
                from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll 
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire 
                curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long 
                for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to 
                the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during 
                interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack 
                developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
